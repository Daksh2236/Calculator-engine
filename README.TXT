22. This is what's printed:

    Testing the addition operation.
    The result is: 7
    Testing the subtraction operation.
    The result is: 5
    All tests passed.
    
    Yes, i believe the final line because the only methods to test are the plus and minus in the 
    CalEngineTester class
    
23. The givin result is 1 which is not the same as the printed result
    When called a second time it returns 7
    it should always return the answer 7
    
24. When done with the minus the value drops to 5 then to -13
